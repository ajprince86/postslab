First thing we must do is install react-router in our terminal
command = "npm install --save react-router-dom"
move to the index.js file

import {BrowserRouter as Router} from 'react-router-dom'

We will then wrap it around the App component.
This ensures that everything inside app will be able to use routing

Head back to app.js
Import {NavLink(Link),Route,Routes}from 'react-router-dom
NavLink is customizable. It is a component for setting the URL and providing navigation between components without triggering a page refresh. We make it clickable by placing the "to" navigate to whatever endpoint.

Rendiring information based on our route.
 Whenever the url ends with "/", Home component must be rendered.
